Biconnectivity Test Cases
=========================

This .zip archive contains 3 subdirectories:  tests, dots, generator

  * "tests" contains a number of random graphs of various sizes in the
    input format specified below.  Each should be connected and have 1
    to 10 biconnected components.

    Input format: each file contains a positive integer "N" followed by
    some number of pairs of integers in the range 0 to N-1.  "N"
    represents the number of vertices in the graph, and each pair u v
    represents an edge between vertices u and v.  (Although a good
    program really should check for the following malformed inputs,
    you may simply assume that you never get: negative numbers,
    numbers outside the range 0 to N-1, an even number of integers in
    total (i.e., the last pair is unfinished), or a pair u v where
    u=v, or where either (u,v) or (v,u) duplicates a previous pair in
    the list.)

    Test files are named nXXdYYsZZ.txt, where XX is the number of
    nodes, YY is the approximate average degree and ZZ is the seed to
    the random number generator.

  * "dots": If you are interested in viewing them, the smaller of
    those graphs are also provided as ".dot" files for the wonderful
    <a href=\"http://www.graphviz.org/\">Graphviz</a> program.

  * "generator": Finally, if (and only if) you want to generate
    additional test cases, or are curious, the \"generator\" folder
    contains the C and R code I used to generate these examples.  (No
    warranties, express or implied, etc., etc.)

Also, "testcase.txt" is a simple test case that you may use for
debugging.  Visually, it looks like: testcase.png
