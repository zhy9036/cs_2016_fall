 * Interface PriorityQueue represents an abstract data type (ADT) for a map storing
 * a queue of elements that can be accessed/removed in ascending order,
 * giving fast access to the minimum element.
 * 
 * Classes implementing PriorityQueue are generally expected to provide the operations
 * below in O(1) or O(log N) average runtime, except for the clear, contains,
 * and toString operations, which are often O(N).
