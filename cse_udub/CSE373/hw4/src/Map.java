 * Interface Map represents an abstract data type (ADT) for a map storing
 * a collection of key-value pairs.
 * A map allows efficient insertion, removal, and lookup of pairs by keys.
 * 
 * Classes implementing Map are generally expected to provide the operations
 * below in O(1) or O(log N) average runtime, except for the clear, keySet,
 * and toString operations, which are often O(N).
