	   <h2>EnergySavvy Spellcheck Coding Problem</h2>
			<p>Write a program that reads a large list of English words (e.g. 
			<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/342881/english.dict">this file</a>) or /usr/share/dict/words
			on a unix system into memory, and then reads
			words from stdin, and prints either the best spelling suggestion (based on the rules below), or 
			"NO SUGGESTION" if no suggestion can be found. The program should print
			 "&gt;" as a prompt before reading each word, and should loop until 
			killed.</p>

      <p>This is what an interactive session with your code should look like:</p>

<pre>&gt; sandwich
sandwich
&gt; sheeeeep
sheep
&gt; peepple
people
&gt; sheeple
NO SUGGESTION
&gt;
</pre>

<p>Your code should correct the following three classes of spelling mistakes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Case (upper/lower) errors:  "inSIDE" =&gt; "inside"</li>
<li>Repeated letters:  "jjoobbb" =&gt; "job"</li>
<li>Incorrect vowels:  "weke" =&gt; "wake"</li>
</ul>

<p>Any combination of the above types of error in a single word should 
be corrected (e.g. "CUNsperrICY" =&gt; "conspiracy" or "ffoaoaoaoaoaoaaoaoaoaoaoadd" =&gt; "food").</p>

<p>If the word is in the dictionary, your program should respond with that word.</p>

<p>If there are many possible corrections of an input word, your program
can choose one in any way you like. It just has to be a word from the
dictionary that is a spelling correction of the input by the above rules.</p>

<p>Extra credit:  Write a second program that *generates* words with 
spelling mistakes of the above form, starting with correctly spelled 
English words. Pipe its output into the first program and verify that 
there are no occurrences of "NO SUGGESTION" in the output.</p>

<p>This problem should take two to four hours. If you're spending much more
than that, it's fine to stop and send us what you have along with an outline
of what's left.</p>

<p>Please don't put your solution in a publicly accessible location (ie. public GitHub repo).</p>
